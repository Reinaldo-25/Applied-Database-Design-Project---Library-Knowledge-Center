This collaborative project enhanced an existing Oracle-based database system for library management in BINUS University to make it more secure, reliable, and advanced. We improvements some part of the features, such as:

1. Added constraints and validation to prevent invalid reservations (e.g., room cannot be booked without responsible person).
2. Implemented audit logs and data integrity rules to ensure secure operations.
3. Optimized database schema and queries for better performance.
4. Maintained full CRUD operations for Members, Rooms, Reservations, Books, and Payments.

Tools we used:
- Database: Oracle SQL
- Tools: SQL Developer / phpMyAdmin
- Concepts: Constraints, Triggers, Normalization, CRUD operations, Audit logging
